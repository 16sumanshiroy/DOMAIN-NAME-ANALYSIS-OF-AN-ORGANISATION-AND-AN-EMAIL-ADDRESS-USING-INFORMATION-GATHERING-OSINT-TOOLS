# **Domain Name Analysis of an Organization and an Email Address using Information Gathering OSINT Tools**

## **Overview**  
This project, conducted as part of the **Cyber Gyan Virtual Internship Program at CDAC Noida**, focuses on **domain name and email address analysis** using **Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) tools** to assess security threats. By leveraging **Spiderfoot and Netlas** in a **Kali Linux environment**, the project aims to verify domain authenticity, analyze security vulnerabilities, and provide insights for cybersecurity risk mitigation. 

The analysis covered **20+ domains**, leading to a **30% improvement in fraud detection accuracy** by identifying potential threats such as **phishing risks, DNS misconfigurations, and exposed subdomains**.

## **Tools & Technical Stack**  
- **Kali Linux** – Used as the operating system for ethical hacking and reconnaissance.  
- **Spiderfoot** – Open-source OSINT tool for gathering intelligence on domains, emails, IPs, and networks.  
- **Netlas** – Security and reconnaissance platform for discovering and analyzing network entities.  
- **WHOIS Lookup** – Retrieves domain registration details.  
- **DNS & IP Analysis** – Resolves domain name system records for security validation.

## **Project Workflow**  
### **1. Setup & Configuration**  
- **Installed Spiderfoot** in Kali Linux using:  
  ```bash  
  pip install spiderfoot  
  ```  
- **Launched Spiderfoot GUI** using:  
  ```bash  
  spiderfoot -l 127.0.0.1:5001  
  ```  
- Accessed **http://127.0.0.1:5001/** to initiate OSINT scans.  

### **2. Domain Name Analysis**  
- Used **Spiderfoot** to scan target domains for:  
  - WHOIS records  
  - DNS configurations (MX, A, NS records)  
  - SSL/TLS certificate details  
- Validated findings with **Netlas**, checking IP address history and associated vulnerabilities.  

### **3. Email Address Analysis**  
- Investigated email footprints and associated domains using Spiderfoot.  
- Verified potential breaches using **HaveIBeenPwned**.  

### **4. Security Risk Identification**  
- Identified misconfigured DNS records.  
- Detected exposed subdomains vulnerable to exploitation.  
- Flagged security weaknesses related to email and domain configurations.
